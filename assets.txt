Godot Asset Strategy: Arcana Ascension

1. The Modular Card System

Do not create unique textures for every card tier. Instead, build a Single Card Scene in Godot that uses layers.

Layer Stack:

The Base: A single parchment texture shared by all Common cards.

The Art: One black-and-white ink drawing per Tarot card (78 total).

The Color: Use Godot's Modulate or a shader to add color based on the card's suit.

The Tier Overlay: This is where the magic happens. Use Shaders, not images.

2. Shader-Based Rarity Tiers

Instead of 8 different images per card, create 8 Materials.

Tier

Godot Implementation

Common

Simple CanvasItem material. No extra cost.

Rare

A "MatCap" shader for gold foil that reacts to the card's tilt (using Input.get_gyroscope() or mouse position).

Epic

A simple UV-scrolling shader for wind/weather effects over the Art layer.

Cosmic

A "Noise" shader generating a moving nebula. Mask it so it only shows in the background of the art.

Fractal

A recursive fragment shader. This is purely code-based and requires zero textures.

3. The Architect’s Suite (Customization)

Since you want players to build their own cards, use Godot's ViewportTexture or SubViewport.

The player picks a Font, a Character, and a Pip.

Godot renders these into a single texture at runtime.

You only store the recipe (the IDs of the parts) in your save data, not the actual image.

4. Integrity and Damage

Do not draw "cracked" versions of cards.

Create one Cracked Overlay (a transparent PNG of spiderweb fractures).

Use a shader to "Alpha Clip" the card art where the cracks are.

Increase the crack_intensity variable in the shader as pips are lost.

5. Summary of Required Assets

78 Art Assets: 1 per Tarot card (keep them as grayscale PNGs).

4 Pip Assets: Cups, Swords, Wands, Pentacles.

8 Shader Files: One for each prestige tier.

5 Audio Clips: Snap, Slide, Flip, Fracture, and Soul Tally.

Total unique image files: ~85. The rest is code.
