Arcana Ascension: Game Design Document

1. Executive Summary

Arcana Ascension is a tactical card game played with a standard 78-card Tarot deck. It uses a 5x5 spatial grid and a high-stakes iterative upgrade system. The game focuses on skill and prestige. Higher card tiers provide visual evolution and leaderboard status. Mechanical power remains identical across all tiers.

2. Core Gameplay Loop

The Match: Fast-paced battles on a 5x5 grid (Standard) or 7x7 grid (Boss).

The Result: Win to earn Souls and cards. Loss causes collection damage.

The Forge: Fuse duplicate cards into corners to increase rarity.

The Exchange: Spend Soul Score on protective items and customization.

Prestige: Sacrifice massive Soul Score for permanent status markers.

3. Combat Mechanics: The Celestial Spread

3.1 Initialization (The World Flip)

Laws are randomized at the start of every match.

The Trump Suit: One suit is chosen as the "Heavenly Suit". All other suits are equal in rank.

Ace Orientation: Aces are either High (14) or Low (1).

3.2 Turn Order (The Border Pulse)

Turn order is determined per-turn. A visual animation flashes between Black and White borders. The color it stops on acts first.

3.3 Targeted Placement (The Locked Axis)

The Highlight: A single Row (1 to 5) or Column (A to E) is highlighted each turn.

Restriction: Both players must play into an empty slot in that specific line.

3.4 The Dominion System (Suit Saturation)

The Claim: When a card is placed in an empty line, that Row and Column designation adopt the suit of that card.

Saturation: A suit symbol appears next to the designation. The line header glows in the color of the player (Silver for White, Gold for Black).

Rule: Players must follow the saturated suit of the line. If they cannot, they must play a Trump or a low card to dump.

3.5 Scoring and Strikes

Row Tally: Completing a row gives the numerical sum of all cards in that row to the player with the highest-value card.

Column Strike: Completing a column lets the winner deduct the total line sum from the opponent's score. The winner does not gain these points. Negatives are possible.

4. The 22 Major Arcana (Global Laws)

Lines are completed, and the winner chooses to Flip (activate) or Pass (stay hidden).

0. The Fool: Clears board and laws. Reshuffles hands and perimeter Arcana.

I. The Magician: Hand cards are Wild for one turn.

II. High Priestess: Shows two possible identities for two perimeter cards (one true, one lie).

III. The Empress: Next 3 lines give double points or strikes.

IV. The Emperor: Next 2 highlights are Rows only.

V. The Hierophant: No Trump plays for 3 turns.

VI. The Lovers: Links two cards. If one is struck, both are struck.

VII. The Chariot: Turn order is no longer randomized. The player who flipped this always goes first.

VIII. Strength: Numerical values of all cards in both hands increase by 5 (max 14).

IX. The Hermit: The opponent's score is hidden until the match ends.

X. Wheel of Fortune: Inverts the suit hierarchy instantly.

XI. Justice: Swaps player scores.

XII. The Hanged Man: The winner of this line skips their next turn. Their opponent must play two cards into the next target.

XIII. Death: Opponent must play cards from highest value to lowest.

XIV. Temperance: All values on the board are averaged. High cards drop and low cards rise.

XV. The Devil: Court cards (Page, Knight, Queen, King) become value 5.

XVI. The Tower: Completed line score becomes zero.

XVII. The Star: Reveals the next 3 cards in the opponent's hand.

XVIII. The Moon: Abolishes the "Follow Suit" rule for the rest of the match.

XIX. The Sun: Reverses the current Ace orientation.

XX. Judgement: Re-evaluates every card on the board based on current suit and Ace laws.

XXI. The World: Triggers a 5-turn countdown to match end.
5. Progression and Integrity

5.1 The Four-Corner Path

1 Corner: 3 cards.

4 Corners (+4): 24 base cards total.

Lockout: At +4, players stop finding that rarity and move to the next tier.

5.2 Corner Integrity

Each corner has 3 Integrity Pips. Losses damage pips. Zero pips breaks the corner. Breaking all corners demotes the card rank.

5.3 The Soul Exchange

Soul Husks: Sacrificial cards that take damage instead of your deck.

Spirit Stitches: Temporary patches for broken corners (lasts 1 match).

6. The Heavens (Weekly Constellations)

Aries: 2x Soul Squares appear on board.

Cancer: Central column slides cards in flow direction.

Sagittarius: Storms blast cards to adjacent spaces. Chain reactions occur if spaces are occupied.

Pisces (Bishop's Path): Diagonals are active. Winners deduct the diagonal sum from the opponent.
